Raindrops Game Algorithm

1.  Create a raindrops class
+  
-Ensure that the raindrops class displays the raindrop and makes it fall in the y direction only
+
2.  Create a catcher class
+  
-The catcher should be circular, follow the mouse, and stay in the same y location
+
3.  Create an array of raindrops
+
4.  Make the raindrops fall 1 at a time
+
5.  Create a score variable
+
6.  Create a method of checking whether the raindrop is touching the catcher
+
7.  When a raindrop touches the catcher...
+
    -Make the score variable increase by 1
+  
   -Make the raindrop disappear/reset (go to the top of the screen)
+
8.  Add a time component to the raindrops game


  -The next raindrop that falls should fall a certain period of time after the one before it
