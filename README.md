Raindrops_Game
==============

Raindrops Game Algorithm

1.  Create a raindrops class
+  
Ensure that the raindrops class displays the raindrop and makes it fall in the y direction only

2.  Create a catcher class
+  
The catcher should be circular, follow the mouse, and stay in the same y location

3.  Create an array of raindrops

4.  Make the raindrops fall 1 at a time

5.  Create a score variable

6.  Create a method of checking whether the raindrop is touching the catcher

7.  When a raindrop touches the catcher...

8.  Make the score variable increase by 1

9.  Make the raindrop disappear/reset (go to the top of the screen)

10. Add a time component to the raindrops game
    The next raindrop that falls should fall a certain period of time after the one before it   

Description

Blue raindrops fall every 3 seconds and all raindrops are removed from the screen when caught.

Each raindrop is worth 1 point, causing the score to increase by 1 when caught.

The start screen is only displayed once, and the start button, like that of a more developed game, inverses color when rolled over.

There is a game over screen that says "You Lose!"

The player initially gets 3 lives, and loses a life everytime he or she doesn't catch a raindrop.

To add to the visual interest, a rainbow spectrum is used in various screens as well as a bonus raindrop which is bright fuchsia.  This goes above and beyond the simple blue raindrop.

Code includes comments for every step in order to clarify everything.

EXTRA FEATURES:

1.  A "You Win!" screen that displays once the score reaches 40
2.  Both the "You Win!" AND "You Lose!" screens feature a fully functional "Play Again!" button
3.  The Play Again button also changes colors when rolled over by the mouse
4.  Rather than leading back to the start screen, "Play Again!" leads straight to the initial gameplay for a more professional function
5.  8 fully-functional levels that increase the speed of the normal (blue) raindrops as well as decrease the size of the catcher in order to incorporate an element of challenge
6.  A BONUS raindrop that is pink in color, falls at a random time interval between 10 seconds adn 1 minute, and provides an extra life when caught
7.  There is no penalty when the bonus raindrop surpasses the bottom of the screen


POTENTIAL GLITCHES:

When at a high level and the catcher's diameter is around 5 pixels, the end screen displays at approximately 2 lives rather than 0
